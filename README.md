## Future to-do
Prioritizing deployment over perfectionism:
- [ ] Adapt the project arquitecture to better practices
- [ ] Simplify the Watchlist methods and apply nested function calls
- [ ] Reduce the Movie and Watchlist Node to a single Node File (removes duplicated code)
- [ ] Check if there are any security flaws or better security practices to implement
